# Salary_Prediction_Project
Final project for bootcamp. Analyze datasets with a machine learning model to predict potential salaries for roles that Data Analytics Bootcamp graduates are elegible to apply. We believe this could be useful to any graduate from the Bootcamp. 

## Data Source
The source of the data is [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries). The raw data contains information about more than 60k employees from top tech companies. This significant amount of data makes our analysis possible. Not only does it include information about the base salary, but also about bonus, stocks, years of experience, company salary levels and location. This gives us plenty of room for analysis. 

## Guiding Questions 
We aim to make a prediction about the salaries that the graduates from the Data Analytics Bootcamp could obtain. We take in consideration the years of experience and each companyâ€™s salary level. We asked ourselves the following questions:
- Based of their experience, what salary can the graduates expect?  
- What would that salary be in the Florida area? 
- In the case of a remote job, what would the salary be for other estates in the US?
- Do the years of experience at the same company have an effect on the salary increase?
